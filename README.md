Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the next big technology to harness. From smart fridges to self-driving cars, AI is implemented in almost everything you can think of. So let's get ahead of the pack and learn how we can leverage the power of AI with Python and OpenAI
we'll learn how to create a blog generator with GPT-3, an AI model provided by OpenAI. The generator will read a topic to talk about as the input, and GPT-3 will return us a paragraph about that topic as the output.

So AI will be "writing" stuff for us. Say goodbye to writer's block!

But wait, hold on! Artificial intelligence?! AI models?! This must be complicated to code. ðŸ˜µ
